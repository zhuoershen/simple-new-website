creative portion
- JS button and redirection (see “reg_btn” on the index page)
- random salt for pwd hashing. never get a duplicate salt (see register.php) 
- share to twitter (see index page)
- **SEARCH** with ranking! ranking is based on **relativities and pertinency**, we DO NOT rank the result by sql. instead we have our own criteria based the story’s author, title and content! For example, if user if searching a number, like “12”, a story with user name include “12”, like “kobe12” will have higher rank than the sport created on “12:00pm”.try to search “kobe” or “12” then look at the ranking of the results!
- fancy CSS layout! good color combo!

something in progress (have me not give this done by the deadline):
- up/down votes
- ranking include votes
- more advanced search
- AJAX
- more security!
